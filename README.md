A port of txtelite.c from Ian Bell's site

Ported to Pascal on Rev 23 Primos. It might work on other revisions, but
untested.

This started purely as an excerise to understand the infamous 'Goat Soup'
Algorithm used to generate the planet descriptions. My 'C' is terrible, source
initially started playing in Lazerus Pascal, but a sudden flash of 
inspiration/stupidty made me think of more era appropiate solutions and
what fun it would have been to have even just this 'text adventure'
version on Primos back-in-the-day.

So here we are!

It's not perfect, but has been an awful lot of fun to do, despite some of the
'restrictions' of Prime's Pascal.

Now working on Version 2 to be a bit prettier using the good ol' VT100 escape codes.

Developed using Notepad++ and uploaded via Kermit.
